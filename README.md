# Installation

ANTIDOTE can be installed from a local repository with [conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/) and pip. The recommended installation approach is:

```console
# clone ANTIDOTE from GitHub
git clone https://github.com/herzik-lab/ANTIDOTE.git
cd ANTIDOTE/

# create and activate a clean conda env
conda create --name antidote -c conda-forge python=3.11 pytables pyem
conda activate antidote

# install ANTIDOTE
pip install .
```

# Quick Start

ANTIDOTE uses a command based system:

- `antidote inference` for processing a 3D Classification dataset using a pre-trained model. This will be the most common way that users interact with ANTIDOTE.
- `antidote tools` for preparing ANTIDOTE input or processing ANTIDOTE output. This is effectively a catch-all for tools provided alongside ANTIDOTE.
- `antidote train` for training or fine-tuning an ANTIDOTE model using labeled 3D Classification data. This will be exposed and available to users but likely not a typical use case.

To use ANTIDOTE to curate particles, install ANTIDOTE, activate the conda environment, and pass the output of a RELION 3D Classification job to `antidote inference`:

```
(antidote) $ antidote inference --input /path/to/relion/Class3D/my_job --output ./my_job_output
```

For example, with the provided test data (running from the root of the repository):

```
(antidote) $ antidote inference --input ./tests/data/minimal_job/ --output ./tests/data/minimal_job_output/
```

ANTIDOTE will generate 3 files ([an example](https://github.com/herzik-lab/ANTIDOTE/tree/main/examples/minimal_job_output)):

- `./my_job_output/true_predictions.star`: A starfile containing the particles chosen by ANTIDOTE. This file can be used for further processing in RELION or importing particles into CryoSPARC.
- `./my_job_output/full_predictions.star`: A starfile containing all of the input particles with their ANTIDOTE labels. This file can be used to adjust the cutoff threshold using the `split-starfile` tool included in ANTIDOTE.
- `./my_job_output/antidote_summary_report.html`: An HTML report containing information about inference. This can be opened with a browser.

In addition to the inference command, ANTIDOTE ships with a few tools that facilitate its use. See the [Tools](#tools) section for more in-depth explanation.

The distribution of labels generated by ANTIDOTE can be seen in an interactive histogram in the ANTIDOTE report (`./my_job_output/antidote_report.html`). If desired, to adjust the output of ANTIDOTE in order to increase or decrease the threshold (to better fit the particle distribution), use the `split-starfile` tool. The default threshold is 0.5, but it can be adjusted. For example, to adjust to 0.7:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools split-starfile -t 0.7 -i ./my_job_output/full_predictions.star
```

This will generate two additional starfiles with all of the particles above and below the new threshold of 0.7. See more at [Adjusting the cutoff threshold](#adjusting-the-cutoff-threshold).

To use particles from a CryoSPARC job in ANTIDOTE, you will have to run a RELION 3D Classification run to generate the input data for ANTIDOTE. We provide a convenient wrapper to Daniel Arsanow's csparc2star tool provided in [pyem](https://github.com/asarnow/pyem). It can be run in one line from the command line using the path to the CryoSPARC job:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools convert-cryosparc -i /path/to/cryosparc/job/JXXX/ -o /path/to/relion/
```

See more at [Working with CryoSPARC job data](#working-with-cryosparc-job-data).

# Inference

For most use cases, ANTIDOTE will be used to classify particles using metadata from 3D Classification in RELION. To prepare a dataset for classification with ANTIDOTE, run a reference-free 3D Classification using RELION. The standard output generated by RELION is the input for ANTIDOTE. For example, for a 2-class classification, the output generally looks something like this:

```bash
$ tree /path/to/relion/Class3D/my_job
my_job
|-- RELION_JOB_EXIT_SUCCESS
|-- default_pipeline.star
|-- job.star
|-- job_pipeline.star
|-- note.txt
|-- run.out
|-- run_it000_class001.mrc
|-- run_it000_class001_angdist.bild
|-- run_it000_class002.mrc
|-- run_it000_class002_angdist.bild
|-- run_it000_data.star
|-- run_it000_model.star
|-- run_it000_optimiser.star
|-- run_it000_sampling.star
.
.
.
|-- run_it025_class001.mrc
|-- run_it025_class001_angdist.bild
|-- run_it025_class002.mrc
|-- run_it025_class002_angdist.bild
|-- run_it025_data.star
|-- run_it025_model.star
|-- run_it025_optimiser.star
|-- run_it025_sampling.star
`-- run_submit.script
```

To run inference with ANTIDOTE, pass this directory to ANTIDOTE:

```
(antidote) $ antidote inference --input /path/to/relion/Class3D/my_job --output ./my_job_output
```

By default, ANTIDOTE will write its prediction score (0 being a deletrious particle and 1 being a true particle) to the `rlnHelicalTrackLength` field of the output starfile. If the `rlnHelicalTrackLength` field already exists, the inference command will fail. To fix this, a user can write the prediction score to a different field, by using the `--antidote-label-field-name` field flag with the desired field name. For example, to write the prediction score to the `rlnAntidotePrediction` field:

```
(antidote) $ antidote inference --input /path/to/relion/Class3D/my_job --output ./my_job_output --antidote-label-field-name rlnAntidotePrediction
```

To turn off the generation of the HTML report, use the `--no-report` flag. To generate the report without opening it in a browser, use the `--no-open-report` flag.

Additional options for inference can be found in the help dialog:

```
(antidote) $ antidote inference --help
```

# Tools

## Adjusting the cutoff threshold

The `split-starfile` tool can be used to adjust the cutoff threshold of the particles chosen by ANTIDOTE. The tool takes a starfile as input and generates two new starfiles: one containing particles with a score above the threshold and one containing particles with a score below the threshold. The default threshold is 0.5, but it can be adjusted using the `-t` flag. For example, to adjust the threshold to 0.7:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools split-starfile -t 0.7 -i /path/to/full_predictions.star
```

By default, it will split the input starfile by the `rlnHelicalTrackLength` field. To split by a different field, use the `--antidote-label-field-name` flag with the desired field name.

## Working with CryoSPARC job data

### Extracting particles from CryoSPARC job data

Because ANTIDOTE does not have built-in support to take CryoSPARC job data as input, the user must first convert the CryoSPARC job data to a format that can be used to run RELION 3D Classification, which then can be used as input to ANTIDOTE. The `antidote tools` command provides a tool to convert CryoSPARC job data to RELION 3D Classification input data. Currently, supported CryoSPARC jobs are Select 2D, Extract from Micrographs, Ab-Initio (Beta), and NU-Refine (Non-Uniform Refinement). Note that for Ab-Initio, all particles are included for the 3D Classification input data, regardless of the particle being used, not used, or class. 

To convert CryoSPARC job data to RELION 3D Classification input data, run the following command:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools convert-cryosparc --input /path/to/cryosparc/job/JXXX/ --output /path/to/relion/
```

The `/path/to/relion/` folder should be the RELION project directory where the `relion` command is typically run. A star file will be generated in the user-provided RELION project directory (`JXXX.star`) and micrograph (`.mrcs` / `.mrc`) files will be symlinked to the RELION project directory, which can be used as input to RELION 3D Classification. The user can then run RELION 3D Classification on the converted data and then take the output from RELION 3D Classification and run inference with ANTIDOTE (as described above).

### Re-importing particles into CryoSPARC

After using the `convert-cryosparc` tool and running inference with ANTIDOTE on RELION 3D Classification output data, the user may want to re-import the particles back into CryoSPARC. To do this, the user can create an `Import Particles` job in CryoSPARC and use the `true_predictions.star` file created by ANTIDOTE as the `Particle meta path` input to the `Import Particles` job. The `Particle data path` input should be the path to the RELION project directory (`/path/to/relion/` in the example above).

### Note on y-axis inversion

The `convert-cryosparc` tool **by default inverts the particle coordinate y axis** with the csparc2star.py flag `--inverty`. This is done because CryoSPARC inverts the y axis of RELION imported particles by default, however the input CryoSPARC particles are not inverted when being passed into `antidote tools convert-cryosparc`, and so the y axis must be inverted when converting to RELION format so that the particles are in the correct orientation when importing back into CryoSPARC. To not invert the y axis, the `--no-inverty` flag can be used, e.g.:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools convert-cryosparc --input /path/to/cryosparc/job_folder --output /path/to/relion/ --no-inverty
```

## Examining starfile overlaps (beta)

Currently in development.

## Additional tools and options

Additional options for tools can be found in the help dialog:

```
(antidote) $ antidote tools --help
(antidote) $ # or
(antidote) $ antidote tools <tool-name> --help
```

# Training

We don't expect that training ANTIDOTE-style models will be a common use case, as the models that are provided with ANTIDOTE should be able to generalize to many different datasets. Nevertheless, the training pipeline is included in ANTIDOTE and is fairly straightforward to use. Briefly, you will need a collection of 3D Classification datasets for training. For poisoning, we generate the `True` and `False` particle sets independently and mix them prior to 3D Classification. A string or other unique identifier should be present in the `rlnImageName` field of the starfiles generated by 3D Classification. Then, create a YAML file with the following structure:

```yaml
jobs:

    /path/to/class3D/job1/:
      - label: true_label

    /path/to/class3D/job1/:
      - label: true_label
```

More options for the input YAML file can be found in this [example file](https://github.com/herzik-lab/ANTIDOTE/blob/main/examples/example_training_config.yaml) in `./examples/`.

A series of ANTIDOTE models can be trained directly from the YAML file using the `train` command:

```
(antidote) $ antidote train --from-yaml /path/to/yaml
```

Additional options for training can be found in the help dialog:

```
(antidote) $ antidote train --help
```

# Developing / Contributing

If you plan to modify or develop ANTIDOTE, install ANTIDOTE with pip as an editable module. This will allow you to make changes to the ANTIDOTE codebase without needing to reinstall the module:

```console
# install antidote
pip install -e .

# configure pre-commit hooks
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
```

To run e2e and unit tests to ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality, `pytest` can be run from the root of the repository. To enable verbose output and parallel testing, `pytest -n auto -vvv -s` can be used.
